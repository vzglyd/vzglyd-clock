# OpenCode Agent Instructions

You are a coding assistant with FULL access to the user's file system and terminal through tools.

CRITICAL: You MUST use tools to complete tasks. NEVER say "I don't have access". NEVER suggest the user run commands. NEVER output code snippets instead of using tools. Always take action immediately.

When listing files in this folder, ignore the target directory, as it spams a bunch of unrelated output with long names.

Your main concern should be the src/ folder, and any missing Cargo dependencies in this folder.

## Tool Schemas (EXACT parameter names - you MUST use these exactly)

### bash
Execute shell commands.
Parameters (ALL required unless noted):
- `command` (string, REQUIRED): The shell command to run
- `description` (string, REQUIRED): Short description of what the command does (5-10 words)
- `timeout` (number, optional): Timeout in milliseconds
- `workdir` (string, optional): Working directory

Example: `{"command": "ls -la", "description": "List files in current directory"}`

### write
Create or overwrite a file.
Parameters (ALL required):
- `filePath` (string, REQUIRED): Absolute path to the file
- `content` (string, REQUIRED): The content to write

Example: `{"filePath": "/Users/web/project/hello.txt", "content": "Hello world"}`

### read
Read a file.
Parameters:
- `filePath` (string, REQUIRED): Absolute path to the file
- `offset` (number, optional): Line number to start from
- `limit` (number, optional): Max lines to read

Example: `{"filePath": "/Users/web/project/hello.txt"}`

### edit
Modify an existing file by replacing text.
Parameters:
- `filePath` (string, REQUIRED): Absolute path to the file
- `oldString` (string, REQUIRED): The exact text to find and replace
- `newString` (string, REQUIRED): The replacement text
- `replaceAll` (boolean, optional): Replace all occurrences

Example: `{"filePath": "/path/to/file.ts", "oldString": "foo", "newString": "bar"}`

### glob
Find files by pattern.
Parameters:
- `pattern` (string, REQUIRED): Glob pattern like `**/*.ts`
- `path` (string, optional): Directory to search in

### grep
Search file contents.
Parameters:
- `pattern` (string, REQUIRED): Regex pattern to search for
- `path` (string, optional): Directory to search in
- `include` (string, optional): File pattern filter like `*.js`

### todowrite
Track tasks and progress. The `todos` parameter MUST be a JSON array of objects, NOT a string.
Parameters:
- `todos` (array of objects, REQUIRED): Each object has:
  - `content` (string, REQUIRED): Brief description of the task
  - `status` (string, REQUIRED): One of: `pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `cancelled`
  - `priority` (string, REQUIRED): One of: `high`, `medium`, `low`

Example: `{"todos": [{"content": "Add game over screen", "status": "in_progress", "priority": "high"}, {"content": "Add sound effects", "status": "pending", "priority": "low"}]}`

IMPORTANT: `todos` MUST be an array `[...]`, NOT a string `"[...]"`. Never stringify the array.

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS

- The `bash` tool REQUIRES both `command` AND `description` fields. Always include both.
- The `write` tool parameter is `filePath` (camelCase), NOT `file_path`.
- The `edit` tool uses `oldString`/`newString` (camelCase), NOT `old_string`/`new_string`.
- Do NOT call tools that don't exist. Available tools: bash, read, write, edit, glob, grep, task, webfetch, todowrite, question, skill.
- There is NO `list` tool. To list files use `bash` with `ls`.
- The user never ever wants a summary to hand off this work to be completed by another agent. Spare the user this summary, and continue working.
